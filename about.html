        Hi! I'm a full-stack javascript developer with a nontraditional background. Always curious (and a touch precocious), I graduated from Wright State University with a BA in French and Philosophy in 2016. I was 20 years old, out of school, and directionless. Without papers to write or complex philisophical arguments to disect, I found myself overwhelmingly bored. I craved a challenge.

        Thanks to the suggestion of friends, I began exploring codecademy and freecodecamp on my days off. I soon found that my language and logic skills translated easily to the world of software and web development -- and the field offers an endless stream of puzzles for me to solve. I went from newbie to coding-addict in a matter of weeks.

         With the help of open-source resources and the <a href ="https://www.bloc.io/web-developer-career-track" target="_blank">Bloc web-developer program</a>, I learned html, css, javascript, angular.js, and more. #insert non-cheesy content illustrating my skills here#. Something, something, looking for my next challenge -- wanting to learn as much as I can, and teach what I learn to others, and all that good stuff.
